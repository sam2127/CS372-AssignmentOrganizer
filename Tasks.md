# Remaining work
<br>

Below is the list of remaining tasks that we must target to finish for our project.  

As of today, it's a long list but as a team and with everyone's contribution we should be able to finish everything in time. So feel free to pick up a task that you think you can complete, even if you are not listed as owner against it.  

The task ownership is assigned based on previous discussions and expected contribution from each one of us. It can change as we work towards completing them, however we must keep the distribution of contribution fair.  

At minimum, everyone is expected to learn/know [git](https://git-scm.com/) in order to make meaningful contributions. So make sure that you spend time on learning [basic git](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).  

If you need hands-on learning, then try [Git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron). 

Also, this [Git cheatsheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet) can be handy if you need a quick and concise git command reference.  

The [GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) provides a visual guide of how code contributions are managed in a repository. Get a good grasp of it.  

`Important` Finally, please read the README file on GitHub repository page or in the `master` branch of your locally cloned copy to know more about how to contribute your work.

## Coding  
<br>

While Shubham will take care of the majority of coding part, small contributions like easy bug fixing, HTML only code etc. are expected from other team members.  
<br>

> Majority of the code is plain [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) with the use of [Node.js](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_intro.asp) modules including [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).  
> HTML is written using CSS classes from [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/) framework.  

<br>

Everyone must study the code in `master` branch in order to gain a better understanding of the project and also as part of the preparation for final presentation. Code comments are available in the code which will make it easy to follow the code.  
<br>

> Please read the README file on GitHub repository page or in the `master` branch of your locally cloned copy to know more about how to contribute your work. It is mandatory that you follow the steps outlined there in order to help with managing the code repository without any administrative overhead. This will result in less headache with merging the work and will allow us to focus more on contribution than on solving merge conflicts.  


> A gentle reminder: **Never work on or commit/merge directly into master branch**

## Testing
<br>

Everybody in the group are responsible for testing. Everyone must test latest code changes every week on their assigned OS and report bugs on GitHub. While testing, everyone is supposed to [write test cases](https://www.guru99.com/test-case.html) that they tested, and submit a merge request when their test case writing and testing is complete. It is important to document and track testing activities in order to validate our work against project's functional and quality requirements. The test cases prepared here will be used in report.  
<br>

Test cases will be added to GitHub repo and writing test cases will be a team work. Shubham will provide test cases for home page which can be used as a template for other pages.

## Report
<br>

If we commit to the tasks in coding and testing sections, then half of those tasks will help produce the report. In other words, we will have contents ready for report which will need only some rephrasing, formatting and proof reading.  
<br>
